= timeoutservice

This sample app was written as a POC for the idea of a simple gateway for microservices. I know SpringBoot has a better (more thought out) solution. 

But I wanted to play with annotations, ExecutorService, etc

== Quick start

Build using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

Run using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn exec:java
----
